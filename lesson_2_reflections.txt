What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Sets the .git folder.  This contains files not necessary for the user.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area holds files waiting to be committed.  The working directory is your hard drive.  Prepare file to be committed without actually commiting them.
