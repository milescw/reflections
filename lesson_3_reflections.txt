When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You might want to share your work with others or co-workers and/or other collaborators.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	There might me a change that you do now want and if Git automatically updated with remote you would get an  unwanted change.
