When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	You might want to share your work with others or co-workers and/or other collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might me a change that you do now want and if Git automatically updated with remote you would get an  unwanted change.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks - are a more convenient way to clone another repository within Github.
	clones - are away to get the code from a repository onto your local machine.
	branches - allow developers to experiment with new features without directly changing the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	The benefit of having a compy of the last known state of the remore stored locally is that you know
	that you have the latest copy to work with. This help ensure you are working with the most update
	source.  This might also help with merge changes going forward, minimizing the necessary changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Collaboration without Git or GitHub would be difficult and cumbersome.  Collaborators would need to devise
	a way to keep track of file changes and figure out a way to merge changes together.  It might be easier because
	users would not have to conform to Git or GitHub's way.  It would be harder becuase Git and GitHub tools would not be available.  I think overall, it would be easier to use Git and GitHub as opposed to not using.
