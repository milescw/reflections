When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You might want to share your work with others or co-workers and/or other collaborators.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	There might me a change that you do now want and if Git automatically updated with remote you would get an  unwanted change.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 	forks - are a more convenient way to clone another repository within Github.
 	clones - are away to get the code from a repository onto your local machine.
 	branches - allow developers to experiment with new features without directly changing the master branch.
